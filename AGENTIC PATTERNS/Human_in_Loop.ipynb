       "  'content': 'On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition.[29]\\nTwo days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, Biden announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University\\'s Marcella Nunez-Smith.[30]\\nOn January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term.[31][32] President-elect Biden had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.[33][34]\\nOn January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden\\'s election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes.[35][36] More than 26,000 National Guard members were deployed to the capital for the inauguration, with thousands remaining into the spring.[37]\\nOn January 20, 2021, Biden was sworn in by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts as the 46th president of the United States, completing the oath of office at 11:49\\xa0am EST, eleven minutes before the legal start of his term.[38][39]\\nInaugural address\\nBiden\\'s inaugural speech laid out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice.[40] The union representing ICE agents signaled that its agents would not accept reversals of Trump policies.[232]\\nIn March 2021, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to Venezuelans fleeing the country amidst the ongoing political and economic crisis.[234]\\nOn June 1, 2021, the\\xa0DHS officially terminated the\\xa0Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which mandated that all\\xa0asylum seekers\\xa0from\\xa0Central America\\xa0were to wait in\\xa0Mexico\\xa0pending their court cases; however, a health order from March 2020 allowed the border authorities to send migrants back for the duration of the\\xa0COVID-19 pandemic\\xa0have remained in place.[235][236] However, on August 14, 2021, a federal judge in Texas ordered the Biden administration to reimplement the policy; the Supreme Court placed a pause on the ruling to give the administration time for arguments.[237][238] On August 24, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration must comply with the lower court\\'s ruling to reinstate the policy.[239][240]\\nEarly on in Biden\\'s tenure, a surge in unaccompanied minors at the U.S. border stirred controversy. The administration also expanded ties with West Africa, including support for infrastructure improvements at the Benin seaport of Cotonou, a key part of the West African economy.[372][376] Biden appointed longtime U.S. diplomat Johnnie Carson to coordinate implementation of U.S. actions following up from the summit.[377]\\nDuring the 2022 summit, Biden and senior administration officials also met privately with six African leaders facing elections in 2023, pushing them to ensure free and fair elections in their nations.[377]\\nSenator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has criticized the Biden administration for hesitating to impose sanctions on the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia, where many atrocities and war crimes were committed in the Tigray War.[378]\\nArmenian genocide\\nOn April 24, 2021, the Biden administration declared that the Turkish killings of Armenians at the start of the 20th century were a genocide. Others criticize the CDC for implementing this change following lobbying by Delta Airlines, leading to social media backlash against the federal government.[117]\\nBiden gave a speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on September 12, 2022, the 60th anniversary of Kennedy\\'s We Choose to Go to the Moon speech, promoting his administration\\'s revival of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot, including the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.[118]\\nEconomy\\nOn January 22, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump\\'s policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions.[119][120][121] Biden\\'s executive order also promotes a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and repeals three of Trump\\'s executive orders which made the employee discipline process stricter and restricted union representatives\\' access to office space. Biden partly attributed the lack of early evacuation of Afghan civilians to the Afghan government\\'s opposition of a \"mass exodus\" which they thought would cause a \"crisis of confidence\".[360]\\nOn August 26, a suicide attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 people, including at least 62 Afghan civilians, 13 US service members, two British nationals and the child of a third British national.[361][362] Biden made a public address following the attack, in which he honored the American service members who were killed, calling them \"heroes\" and saying they lost their lives \"in the service of liberty\", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Significantly more Democrats voted in the 2020 election than in previous presidential contests, and the Democratic Party not only won the presidential election but also maintained its control of the U.S. House of Representatives and took control of the U.S. Senate from Republicans, though only by the slimmest of margins (the resulting Senate membership was evenly divided between the two parties at 50 senators each, but tie votes could be broken by Vice President Harris, acting in her constitutional role as president of the Senate). Biden supported three significant pieces of voting rights and electoral-reform legislation: the For the People Act, passed by the House in March 2021; the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, passed by the House in August; and the Freedom to Vote Act, introduced in the Senate in September. The failure of the electoral-reform measures, which Democrats viewed as essential to preserving American democracy, prompted progressive and even some moderate Democrats to urge the elimination of the filibuster, which is not established in the U.S. Constitution and can be ended by the Senate in a simple majority vote.\\n In early November, following important off-year elections in which Democrats suffered several unexpected defeats—signaling a likely loss of the House and Senate to Republicans in the 2022 election—Biden and Democratic House leaders intensified their efforts to reconcile the factions, arguing that some tangible legislative achievement was necessary to retain the support of swing voters. During and after the withdrawal, the Biden administration was criticized by Republican and some Democratic leaders for having misjudged the strength and resolve of both the Taliban and the Afghan government and security forces.'},\n",

In the White House Rose Garden with his wife, Jill, and President Obama by his side, Biden made his announcement, referring to his son’s recent death in his decision making: “As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I’ve said all along what I’ve said time and again to others, that it may very well be that the process by the time we get through it closes the window. I started my career fighting for civil rights, and to be a part of what is both a moment in American history where the best people, the best ideas, the how can I say it?—the single best reflection of the American people can be called upon—to be at that moment, with a guy who has such incredible talent and who is also a breakthrough figure in multiple ways—I genuinely find that exciting.'},\n",

      "[{\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi\", \"content\": \"New Delhi was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947.[55] It has expanded since; the small part of it that was constructed during the British period has come to be informally known as Lutyens' Delhi.[56]\\nPartition and post-independence\\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[59][60] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[61][62][63] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.[64]\\nThe States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi.[1][2] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\\nDelhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).[8]\\nThe topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. In addition to the wetlands formed by the Yamuna river, Delhi continues to retain over 500 ponds (wetlands < 5 ha (12 acres)), that in turn support considerable number of bird species.[76] Delhi's ponds, despite experiencing ecological deterioration due to garbage dumping and concretisation, support the largest number of bird species known to be using ponds anywhere in the world.[77] Existing policy in Delhi prevents the conversion of wetlands and, quite inadvertently, has led to the city's ponds becoming invaluable refugia for birds.[76][77]\\nThe National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,483 km2 (573 sq mi), of which 783 km2 (302 sq mi) is designated rural, and 700 km2 (270 sq mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[43] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.[44]\\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence.[45] In 1737, Maratha forces led by Baji Rao I sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\\nToponym\\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capitals_of_India\", \"content\": \"Jump to content Personal tools Toggle the table of contents List of capitals of India Tools Find sources: \\\"List of capitals of India\\\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (September 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Vijayanagara: Capital of Vijayanagara Empire from early 14th Century until 1585, when it was abandoned, ostensibly due to lack of water.

To the east the territory is bounded by the state of Uttar Pradesh, and to the north, west, and south it is bounded by the state of Haryana.\\n One of the country’s largest urban agglomerations, Delhi sits astride (but primarily on the west bank of) the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Himalayas. The summer season lasts from mid-March to the end of June, with maximum temperatures typically reaching about 100 °F (about 37 °C) and minimum temperatures falling into the high 70s F (about 25 °C); it is characterized by frequent thunderstorms and squalls, especially in April and May.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-capital-of-india.html\", \"content\": \"Related\\nThe Largest Empires In The History Of India\\nBiggest Ethnic Groups In India\\nMore in World Facts\\nThe Largest Countries In Asia By Area\\n Also, the durbar was held in Delhi so as to welcome the Prince of Wales; hence the British associated Delhi with royal heritage.\\n What is the Capital of India?\\nIndia, also known as the Republic of India is located in South Asia.
